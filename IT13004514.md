#What is Vmotion?#
V-Motion allows move virtual servers and desktops from one physical server to another without having to shut down the virtual desktop or server.
All of this is done in real time without the user of the virtual machine even knowing they have been moved. V-Motion is the first step among many
VMware software solutions that are incorporated to make sure that downtime is kept to a minimum, which include Fault Tolerance, High Availability,
and Digital Resource Scheduler.

# vmotion compatibility #

V Motion has quite a few requirements that need to be in place before it will work correctly. Here is a list of the key requirements for V Motion to
work.

Each host must be correctly licensed

Each host must meet shared storage requirements

Each host must meet the networking requirements

Each compatible CPU must be from the same family

When configuring vMotion between hosts I would recommend keeping to one brand of server per cluster, i.e. Dell, HP, IBM. Also always ensure that
these servers are compatible with each other. You can confirm this by speaking to the server manufacturer.

A very important item to consider is to always ensure you are using the latest BIOS version on each of your hosts. Ensuring that the CPU’s are
compatible with each other is essential for vMotion to work successfully, this is because the host that the virtual machine migrates to has to be
capable of carrying on any instructions that the first host was running.
If a virtual machine is successfully running an application on one host and you migrate it to another host without these capabilities the application
would most likely crash, possibly even the whole server would crash, hence why vMotion compatibility is required between hosts before you can
migrate a running virtual machine.

It is user-level instructions that bypass the virtualisation layer such as Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), SSE2 SSSE3, SSE4.1 and Advanced
# CPU Compatibility  of Vmotion #

 The CPU compatibility problem is easy to explain. Imagine that a virtual machine is started on an ESX host with an AMD CPU and SSE3 functionality. Since VMware ESX is a virtualizer, the guest operating system sees all of the standard CPU functionality and can be adapted to the hardware with extra drivers to more effectively utilize multimedia functions.  
If this virtual machine is simply transferred to another host with a CPU that only supports SSE2, the guest operating system will still want to use the SSE3 functionality. This can cause problems or even a system crash. While these problems can sometimes be managed by so-called “CPU masking”, very large differences between CPUs remain unresolvable. Examples of large differences include switching from an AMD to an Intel CPU, or from a 64-bit to a 32-bit CPU.  
 Since the ESX server cannot predict which CPU instructions the virtual machine (or rather the guest operating system) will use, the user must pay attention to either use identical CPUs or to configure a proper masking. 



 Other main thing of  vmotion compatibility  is require  huge RAM . At least 12 OR 16 GB RAM. Because we have to run 2 virtual machine.   



# Usage of Vmotion migration  #
#### 01)Improve overall hardware utilization ####
#### 02)Allow  continued virtual machine operation while accommodating scheduled hardware downtime ####
#### 03)Allow vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler(DRS) to balance virtual machines across hosts ####

# Benefit of Vmotion  #

#### The main benefit is that you can add servers with the latest processors to your existing cluster(s) seamlessly and without incurring any downtime.
More importantly, EVC (Enhanced vmotion compatibility) provides you with the flexibility required to scale your infrastructure, lessening the need to
decommission older servers prematurely, thus maximizing ROI. It also paves the way for seamless cluster upgrades once the decision to retire old
hardware is taken. 

• Automatically optimize and allocate entire pools of resources

By having all server and/or desktops virtualized we can move VM’s from one physical host to another, which is done rapidly over a high speed
network connection, the original host and destination host stay in sync until the transfer it complete leaving the user unaware of the move. This
allows network administrators to easily select resource pools to assign to the different VMs.

• Move VM’s from failing or underperforming priorities
If there looks like a server is about to fail or is reaching its capacity, administrators can manually move VMs to another physical host, this allows us
data center to be more dynamic in nature. Instead of having to upgrade hardware, we can move VM to another host to allow each VM to be more
flexible in nature. If 2 VM's are putting a physical host to capacity then we could move one to another server that isn't being used as much.
• Minimizes scheduled Downtime
90% of downtime is scheduled, before V-Motion administrators had to do server maintenance late at night in order to avoid disrupting users.
Having all the servers as virtual machines, we only have to move the VM to another physical host, creating zero downtime for the users and
allowing administrators to perform maintenance at any time. With DRS (Digital Resource Manager), all we have to do is put a server in
maintenance mode and V-Motion will automatically move all VM's to another server.

# Disadvantages of Vmotion #
When a new family of processors is released to market, innovative microprocessor features and instruction sets are often included. These features
include performance enhancements in areas such as multimedia, graphics or encryption. With this in mind try to determine in advance the type of
applications you’ll be running in your vSphere environment. This gives you a rough idea of the type of processors you’ll be needing. This, in turn,
allows you to predetermine the applicable EVC modes when mixing servers with processors from different generations



When weighing in the disadvantages, application performance springs first to mind. For instance, if SSL intensive applications are your thing, you
should avoid at all costs the inclusion of servers equipped with pre-Westmere generation processors. Why? Westmere improves AES performance
by a factor of 3 in part due to its AES-NI instruction set. Now let’s imagine that you have a cluster of 4 servers equipped with Westmere CPUs and
you urgently need to add a 5th node which happens to be an “old” server with pre-Westmere generation processors. What happens is that once
this server is added to the cluster, the “best” available EVC mode is determined by the “oldest” processor. Put simply, you lose all the benefits
AES-NI brings with it and in doing so drastically slow down any SSL intensive applications that are hosted on the cluster.


# Pros of V-Motion #
• Dynamic allocation services of the software allow you to allocate resources and memory while the processes are running.

• Security service of the software is flexible and allows you to implement user defined policy enforcement.

• The software supports all major operating systems as well as wide range of hardware.

• V-Motion allows to precisely identify the optimal placement for virtual machine.

• Virtual machines can be optimized within resource pools automatically.

# Cons of V-Motion #
• There is no module for performance management on the software.

• Unlike its competitors, the software does not offer any reporting capabilities.

• Configuration features of the software do not include auto recovery, configuration history, and NIC teaming capabilities.

• There are no performance management features of adaptive analysis, memory compression, and continuous resource allocation on the software.

# How does Vmotion migration work? #
##
First, the entire state of a virtual machine is encapsulated by a set of files stored on shared storage. VMware’s clustered Virtual Machine File
System (VMFS) allows multiple installations of ESX Server to access the same virtual machine files concurrently.

Second, the active memory and precise execution state of the virtual machine is rapidly transferred over a high speed network. This allows the
virtual machine to instantaneously switch from running on the source ESX Server to the destination ESX Server. V-Motion keeps the transfer period
imperceptible to users by keeping track of on-going memory transactions in a bitmap. Once the entire memory and system state has been copied
over to the target ESX Server, V-Motion suspends the source virtual machine, copies the bitmap to the target ESX Server, and resumes the virtual
machine on the target ESX Server. This entire process takes less than two seconds on a Gigabit Ethernet network.

Third, the networks used by the virtual machine are also virtualized by the underlying ESX Server. This ensures that even after the migration, the
virtual machine network identity and network connections are preserved. V-Motion manages the virtual MAC address as part of the process. Once
the destination machine is activated, V-Motion pings the network router to ensure that it is aware of the new physical location of the virtual MAC
address. Since the migration of a virtual machine with V-Motion preserves

#####We select the tab Configuration-> Network Adapters and we see that we have visibility of the new connections. (We, for example to make the article we have connected a single network card as you can see vmnic9 that has no assigned Virtual Switch (yet) ...#####
